# Generic Food App
Utilize [Yelp's Fusion API][1] to fetch a list of restaurants nearby and have the ability to like the resaurant and save it to AsyncStorage, or dislike and forget the restaurant for the search.

Tools Used:
+ [React Native][2]

Todo: 
+ Fix restaurant mobile (currently commented out)
+ Store Yelp APIkey in seperate file (currently commented out)
+ Implement Saved list to recall restaurants from AsyncStorage
+ Settings page to add filters
